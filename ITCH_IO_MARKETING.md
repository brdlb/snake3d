# Snake 3D

**A hardcore 3D puzzle-arcade where orientation is everything.**

## 🛑 WARNING: FORGET EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT NAVIGATION

**Yes, the controls are weird. It's QEAD.**

Why? Because in a true 3D Snake game, standard controls don't work.
*   If you look down, you see nothing but your own tail.
*   If you look up, your massive body blocks the entire view ahead.

We solved this by removing "Up", "Down", "Left", and "Right" entirely. Instead, you control your **Orientation**. Use **Q** and **E** to roll, **A** and **D** to turn. 

To master this game, you must unlearn the concepts of "up" and "down". There is only *forward* and *relative rotation*. It will break your brain for the first 10 minutes. Then, it will click, and you will understand why this is the only way to play 3D Snake properly.

## 👻 Asynchronous Multiplayer: You Are Never Alone

You aren't just playing against a high score table. You are playing against **Phantoms**.

Every time you enter a room, it's populated by the ghosts of players who were there before you. These are not bots. They are recordings of actual runs.
*   See a snake make a crazy maneuver? That was a real player.
*   See a massive coiled beast blocking your path? That's the legacy of a survivor.

You don't need a lobby. You don't need to wait for a match. The world is always full, living, and dangerous.

## ⚡ Key Features

*   **Brain-Twisting Controls**: A unique control scheme designed specifically for 3D spatial awareness.
*   **Phantom System**: Compete against the recordings of real players in real-time.
*   **Procedural Infinite World**: Every room is generated from a unique seed.
*   **One Chance**: High stakes gameplay where every move counts.

**Can you re-orient your mind to survive?**
